# CLI for Arduino
This project serves to allow you to run programs on your Arduino by passing space delimited arguments through the serial interface.

The code is based on the [blog post](https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2018/02/creating-a-command-line-interface-in-arduinos-serial-monitor/) by Mads Aasvik.
